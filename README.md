# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
With the help of `imbalanced-learn` and `scikit-learn` we will build and evaluate models using resampling which will help us evalute the credit risk. We will be using algorithims such as as `RandomOverSampler` and `SMOTE` to oversample the data and we will use `ClusterCentroids` to undersample the data. We will then compare the two machine learning models (`BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and `EaseEnsembleClassifier`) and detrime which if any should be used to predict **credit risk**
